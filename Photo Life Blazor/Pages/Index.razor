    <h1>THE CS DEPARTMENT PRESENTS: <br /> <b>PhotoLife Comps</b></h1>
    <br />
    <h6><i>Brought to you by Seniors: Sunny Kim, Alejandro Gonzalez, Peyton Bass, Aidan Lee-Gilligan, & T'airra Champliss.</i></h6>
    <br />
    <p>Welcome to the PhotoLife Comps! Our team embarked on this project to address ethical concerns surrounding the use of metadata and see what
        could be done with the personal metadata stored in the images we take and utilize everyday. By examining the metadata associated with each
        photo, we sought to develop an algorithm capable of making predictions about the authors and collections we had stored. We planned to use 
        this algorithm to create unique photo albums reflecting these predictions. Through further analysis of these photo albums, our intention
        was to build comprehensive profiles for each team member. These profiles would suggest themes related to our identities, personalities, 
        schedules, and other significant aspects of our lives.
        This app is divided into three sections:<br />
        <u>Part One: Metadata Extractor.</u><br />
        <u>Part Two: Album Generator.</u><br />
        <u>Part Three: Profile Maker.</u><br /></p>
        <br />
    <br />
    <h4>Ethics & Uses of Data: </h4>
    <p>
        First and foremost, we emphasize the utmost respect for user privacy and data protection. We recognize the sensitive nature of image metadata
        and handle it with great care, ensuring it is collected and processed securely, and only used for its intended purposes. We strictly adhere to
        applicable laws, regulations, and industry best practices to guarantee the privacy and confidentiality of our users.
        Transparency is another key aspect of our mission. We strive to provide clear and concise information to our users regarding the utilization of 
        image metadata within our algorithms. We believe that transparency fosters trust and allows users to make informed decisions about their data. 
        Our users have the right to know how their information is being utilized, and we make every effort to keep you all well-informed.
        Additionally, we maintain a strong commitment to the responsible and ethical use of image metadata. We actively engage in ethical discussions
        and consulted our comps advisor to ensure that our utilization of this data aligns with the values and expectations of our users and society at large.
        We prioritize the positive impact of our algorithms, while minimizing any potential negative consequences.
        Our mission is to continue to prioritize ethics throughout the entire process of utilizing this data within our algorithms.
